### ❌ NOT Required:
- Website Builder (you're using custom code)

### Option 3: Use "Websites + Marketing" (NOT Recommended)

- ❌ You can't upload custom HTML/CSS/JS files
- ❌ Limited to GoDaddy's templates
- ❌ Can't use your custom design
- ❌ Not suitable for your professional website

**Don't use this option** - it won't work for your custom website.
